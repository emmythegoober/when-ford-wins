    <h2><br><br>When Ford Won<br><br><br><br><br></h2>
    <p>As November 2nd came and went, you felt an uneasy feeling in your chest. It wasn't pain derived from a heart attack, nor a symbol that your constant smoking had caught up to you. It was a fear of numbers, specifically of two numbers—twenty-five and eleven. They were the symbols that you might fall behind; they were the electoral votes for Wisconsin and Ohio. Even under the loving embrace of Betty, you couldn't stop that sentiment. Carter is a good man, but he is not what we need for this nation. He might be a good governor, but he won't make a good president. Reagan? He is a lazy bastard whose only quality is charisma. If we fail, he comes. </p>
    <p><br>What if you hadn't pardoned Nixon? Tons of people said they wouldn't be voting for you because of that. What if you kept Rockefeller? Maybe Pennsylvania and New York would've been yours. It doesn't matter how many what-ifs you could come up with; all that matters is the <i>here and now</i>. This is the moment, Ford, this is the moment that America chooses. The votes in Texas aren't assuring, and while we might have a lead in Ohio, it is narrowing by the minute.</p>

    <p><br>Then Texas flipped. That hurt. That hurt a lot. Reagan could have rallied us in the south, but his massive ego decided against it. North Dakota came for us; it was a small victory, but it was the best you could have at that moment. "Go Blue!" You shouted at the television screen, hoping for some miracle. Wisconsin was still red, and most networks had already called it for Carter. Although his "victory" there meant he had already won the election, some networks hadn't given him the crown—there was still hope of an upset.</p>
    <p><br>You looked across the room for your pipe, but were interrupted by the screen switching to the Midwest.</p>
    <p><br>Ohio was blue, and Wisconsin had gone too close to call.</p>
    <p><br>It wasn't relief that filled your body; it was dread. Dread at the number eleven. Dread over Wisconsin. It didn't matter that you won Ohio; the election hinged on those cheeseheads. If it went to Carter, then victory would have been snatched from you right before your eyes. So close, yet so far. Betty came to comfort you as much as she could. It had been, after all, some turbulent years. You almost died twice, and sometimes you still have nightmares about that gun.</p>
    <p><br>And then Wisconsin went blue.</p>
